# SawStop Brake Triggered Procedure

When [the SawStop brake cartridge is triggered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibp2Gy2CFrY), please:

1. Make sure everyone is okay  
2. Record the incident  
3. Replace the brake cartridge and blade

#### Make Sure Everyone Is Okay

1. Ask the member who triggered the brake cartridge if they're okay.  
2. They'll have a small cut if the blade contacted them. Offer disinfectant and band-aids from the first aid kit behind the front desk.  
3. If they have a serious injury, ask someone to call 911, and use the Stop The Bleed kit behind the front desk.

#### Record The Incident

1. Let the member know we record a safety incident any time the brake cartridge triggers.  
2. Ask what caused the brake cartridge to trigger.  
3. Ask for the member's full name.  
4. Look up the member, and record the date and description of the incident in their User Note field.  
5. Post a description of the incident in the \#woodshop Slack channel.

#### Replace The Brake Cartridge And Blade

1. Disable the SawStop. Turn the disconnect switch on the left side of the SawStop to the off position.  
2. Make a quick "Out Of Order" sign and place it on the SawStop.  
3. Install a new brake cartridge and blade. See [changing the brake cartridge on page 40](https://myturn-prod-attachments.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6/66/item/1084877/file_attachment/ICS-Cabinet-Saw-Manual-374718D7-59E0-4B59-050B-7C97CF6B6E7E.pdf#page=42) of the manual, [changing the blade on page 18](https://myturn-prod-attachments.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6/66/item/1084877/file_attachment/ICS-Cabinet-Saw-Manual-374718D7-59E0-4B59-050B-7C97CF6B6E7E.pdf#page=20). [This video](https://youtu.be/IA4YuT30slw) might also be helpful.  
4. Ensure the saw is working again. Turn the disconnect switch back to the on position, and do a test cut.  
5. Dispose of the old blade. Save the triggered cartridge.  
6. Ensure there is a spare blade and standard brake cartridge for the next time the brake triggers. If one or both is missing, request replacements in the [\#purchase-requests](https://app.slack.com/client/TAAD5LKJ4/C07N9GHE3JA) Slack channel. This model requires LEGACY brake cartridges: [Standard Cartridge](https://www.sawstopstore.com/product/table-saw-brake-cartridge-for-10-blades-clear-fits-model-cb/), [Dado Cartridge](https://www.sawstopstore.com/product/table-saw-dado-cartridge-for-8-in-dado-sets-clear-tsdc-8l/).  
7. [Report the incident to SawStop](https://www.sawstop.com/my-account/report-save/) and send in the triggered cartridge for a low cost replacement (they just charge shipping).

We don't charge members for replacement cartridges and blades the first time they trigger a brake cartridge. We don't expect anyone to trigger the brake cartridge more than once. If they do, the incidents will be reviewed, and the member may be asked to pay for replacements, or be banned from using the table saw.
