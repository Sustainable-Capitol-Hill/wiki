# Routine shift volunteering

This page outlines what's entailed in being a frequent, reliable, and active volunteer with the tool library: the benefits and expectations, and how to take on new roles or less responsibility over time as your life and interests change.

### Thank you

Thank you so so much for being a frequent volunteer at the Capitol Hill Tool Library\! Since we're an all-volunteer organization,  you – in a very real way – are the tool library; without your dedication, time, and energy, the tool library wouldn't exist for our community to utilize and learn from.

### Privileges

The main privilege of being a routine volunteer is access to the tool library at all hours of the day. Using your smart lock access, you can come and go whenever's convenient for you – to work on personal projects, to borrow inventory, to work remotely, etc. (If you haven't received smart lock access yet, just ask anyone on the board\!)

### Guidelines

To retain your privileges, you must continue to be an active volunteer. A long vacation or summer internship is common and totally okay, but if you haven't been in regularly in a while then your permissions may get removed.  
Additionally, you must follow some basic volunteering guidelines:

* If you can't make a shift that you've signed up for, then update the staffing spreadsheet and let your fellow volunteers know as soon as possible. Having up-to-date staffing information helps us move volunteers around and be reliable for patrons.  
* Proactively take on tasks during shifts, especially by serving in-person patrons and supporting fellow volunteers. You don't need to take on work that you're uncomfortable with or don't feel qualified for, but don't shy away from tough tasks that need to be done. Quality of service is necessary for gaining and retaining patrons, and those patrons are why we're all here\!  
* Warmly welcome and onboard new volunteers. As an all-volunteer organization we are only as capable as our pool of volunteers, so it's crucial to enthusiastically and thoughtfully get new volunteers established.  
* Every few months we have in-person safety trainings for volunteers, in topics like [traumatic bleeding](https://www.stopthebleed.org/) or de-escalation. You should join if your calendar allows, since these trainings are important for your safety and the safety of those around you.

### Want to take on more?

If you're interested in taking on a bigger role in the tool library, that's amazing to hear, and there are so many different ways to do so. There are two general paths: coordinating and executing on a larger one-off project, or taking on a persistent, long-running responsibility.  
Large projects require multiple shifts and/or multiple volunteers to complete. Generally speaking, as project lead you'd propose a plan on Slack, coordinate other volunteers, and lead execution of the work. If you have ideas for improving inventory organization, volunteer processes, workshop use, community outreach, or anything else, please share those thoughts on Slack so that you can build enthusiasm and make them happen\! Or if you're interested in leading a larger project but need some project ideas, just ask around\!  
Alternatively, you could take on a long-running role at the tool library – anything from traditional board roles like treasurer or secretary, to nonprofit roles like grant writer or volunteer coordinator, to profession-style roles like graphic designer or events manager. Or propose something new that you think the tool library would benefit from\! We're always looking for new ways to better serve the community.

### Need a break?

If you're ever overwhelmed with life or just need a break from volunteering, let us know\! We're excited to have you on the team, but only if volunteering adds to your life rather than making it harder. It's just volunteering, after all. And of course you're always welcome as a patron.  
In these situations, getting in touch also helps us identify ways to make volunteering less onerous and more engaging for yourself and others in the future.

### Thank you again

Really really.
